# Project Overview

This project contains a simple HTML and CSS implementation of a container (#outer) that holds three circular elements (#inner1, #inner2, and #inner3). The circles have different background colors and are styled using basic CSS properties, including borders, margin, and border-radius.

# Purpose 

The goal of this project is to practice the use of div elements and applying CSS properties like height, width, border, margin, and border-radius. This exercise helps with understanding how to structure elements within a container and apply styles to achieve a clean, responsive design.

# Folder Structure

- index.html           # Contains the main structure of the page
- style.css            # Styles the page and elements
  
# Technologies Used

<ul>HTML5</ul>
<ul>CSS3</ul>

# Description

The outer container (#outer) is 200px in height and 70px in width, with a black border.
Inside the container, there are three inner div elements (#inner1, #inner2, and #inner3), each of which has a height and width of 50px and a circular shape (due to the border-radius of 50px).
The inner div elements are spaced apart by 10px margins and are colored red, yellow, and green respectively.
