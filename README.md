## Traffic Light Symbol
This project is a foundational HTML and CSS layout exercise designed to reinforce core front-end development concepts, including element nesting, ID and class-based styling, and external stylesheet integration.

## 📄 Overview
The project consists of a simple HTML document containing an outer container (#outer) and three nested child elements (#inner1, #inner2, #inner3), each styled via a linked CSS file. The intent is to practice layout structuring and visual styling using modern HTML5 and CSS3 conventions.
